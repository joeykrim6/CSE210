1. Program Title
Emotional State Tracker
2. Program Description
The Daily Mood Tracker is a command-line tool that allows users to log and analyze their mood over time. Users input their mood each day (e.g., happy, sad, anxious, excited), and the program stores these entries in a file. It also includes functionality to view mood history, calculate the most common mood, and display how moods have changed over a specified range of dates.
This project is focused on trying to help individuals be more aware of their mental health, and even possibly provide a good reference for those that are in therapy.
